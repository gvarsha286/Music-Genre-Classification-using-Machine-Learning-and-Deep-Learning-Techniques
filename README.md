📌 Music Genres Classification 
This project explored the challenge of predicting music genres using multiple machine learning models. Genre prediction proved to be complex due to the subjective and diverse nature of listener preferences, yet the analysis revealed several meaningful patterns within the dataset.
Key takeaways:
Popularity Trends: Classical music emerged as the least popular genre, while hip-hop and pop dominated the popularity spectrum.
Feature Influence: Loudness and energy showed strong correlation with popularity, whereas duration contributed minimally.
Model Performance:
CNN with RMSProp achieved the strongest performance, with a sensitivity of 0.38 and specificity of 0.897.
Random Forest (RFC) with ADAM optimizer performed best among classical models, reaching 0.571 accuracy, 0.540 precision, and an F1-score of 0.555.
Overall Insight: The findings offer useful direction for improving future music-genre-prediction systems and shed light on evolving listener preferences across genres.
These insights can help guide the development of more robust models and support deeper understanding of the audio features that shape genre popularity.
